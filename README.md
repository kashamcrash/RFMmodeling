# RFMmodeling
Build a RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) model for Retail Customers.
Recency means the number of days since a customer made the last purchase. 
Frequency is the number of purchase in a given period. It could be 3 months, 6 months or 1 year. Monetary is the total amount of money a customer spent in that given period. 
Therefore, big spenders will be differentiated among other customers such as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or VIP.
Build RFM Segments. Give recency, frequency, and monetary scores individually by dividing them into quartiles.
Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and Kmeans.
